        <p>Hello! My name is Jared VanOeffelen and I am a Web Developer. This website is a small passion project that I have made to
          spread love, support, and happiness to this wonderful world. This website is filled with cute animal images and inspirational quotes. It has everything that you
          need for a healthy boost of serotonin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I appreciate any amount of constructive criticism about the aesthetic and overall appeal that this website has to offer. Please feel free to visit the 'Contact Me'
          page and let me know how I did or offer some advice on how I can improve my work. I would love to hear what you think about this project!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am still learning to become a better web developer every day and I hope to build bigger and better projects in the future. Make sure to check out the link below
          to learn more about me and what I have to offer as well as getting the chance to see some of my other projects.
